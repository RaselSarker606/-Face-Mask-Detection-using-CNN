📌 Face Mask Detection using CNNComputer Vision | Deep Learning | CNN

📖 OverviewThis project focuses on detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to classify images into three categories: Mask, No Mask, and Improper Mask to help in ensuring compliance with health regulations.

📂 DatasetThe dataset consists of labeled images categorized into three classes:

Mask: Individuals wearing face masks properly.

No Mask: Individuals not wearing a mask.

Improper Mask: Individuals wearing a mask incorrectly.

🛠️ Methodology
