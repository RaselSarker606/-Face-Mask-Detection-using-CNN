📌 Face Mask Detection using CNN  
Computer Vision | Deep Learning | CNN  

📖 Overview  
This project focuses on detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to classify images into three categories: **Mask**, **No Mask**, and **Improper Mask** to help in ensuring compliance with health regulations.  

📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled images categorized into three classes:  
- **Mask**: Individuals wearing face masks properly.  
- **No Mask**: Individuals not wearing a mask.  
- **Improper Mask**: Individuals wearing a mask incorrectly.  

🛠️ Methodology  
- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.  
  - Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.  
- **Feature Extraction**  
  - Using CNN-based architectures to learn spatial features.  
- **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  - Applied deep learning models:  
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
    - Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet)  
  - Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

📊 Results  
- Achieved high accuracy using **[best performing model]**.  
- Comparative evaluation of different CNN architectures.  
- Insights into the effectiveness of face mask detection models.
